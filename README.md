# Memory Game Application

The Memory Game is a fun and interactive web-based application that challenges your memory skills. The game consists of a set of cards that are flipped face down initially. The objective is to find matching pairs of cards by flipping them two at a time. When two cards with the same technology logo are flipped, they remain face up as a matched pair. The game continues until all pairs are successfully matched.

## How to Play

1. **Start Game:** When you open the application, you will see a "Start Game" button. Clicking on it will prompt you to enter your name.

2. **Enter Your Name:** A pop-up will ask you to enter your name. You can either enter your name or leave it blank to remain anonymous. Clicking the "Ok" button will start the game.

3. **Gameboard:** Once the game starts, you will see a grid of face-down cards, each representing a different technology logo. Your objective is to find all the matching pairs.

4. **Flipping Cards:** Click on any two cards to flip them face up. If the two cards have the same technology logo, they will remain face up (matched) and you will get a point. If they are different, they will be flipped back face down, and you will lose a try.

5. **Tries and Timer:** The game displays the number of wrong tries you have made and a countdown timer, showing the remaining time to complete the game.

6. **Winning:** Keep matching the pairs until all the cards are matched. If you manage to match all pairs before the timer reaches zero, you win the game!

7. **Game Over:** If the timer runs out before you match all the pairs, the game will end, and a "Game Over" message will be displayed. You can choose to try again or cancel the game.

8. **Restart or Exit:** If you choose to try again, the game will be reset, and you can play again. If you decide to exit, the application will close.
